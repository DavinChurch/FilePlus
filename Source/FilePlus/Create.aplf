 tieno←{reserved}Create file;⎕TRAP;cwd;relative
⍝ Create a new FilePlus component file and initialize it with an empty directory.
⍝ Supply a new file name to be created as the right argument.
⍝ If the file name given is a full path, then that is the full file name.
⍝ If only a partial path is specified, then it is assumed to be relative
⍝ to the directory in which ⎕WSID resides.
⍝
⍝ This utility is only required if a relative-path file name is being
⍝ created or if reserved component numbers are to be specified.
⍝ All the companion utilities will work correctly with a file that is
⍝ simply ⎕FCREATEd (and left empty).
⍝
⍝ This new file is exclusively tied upon creation.  If immediate sharing
⍝ is expected, then the file should be untied and retied right away.
