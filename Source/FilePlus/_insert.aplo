 component(tn _insert path)key;leaf;t
⍝ Insert a new data component number with its key to the B-tree at the location specified by path
⍝ Right operand:
⍝      path must have been pre-defined by _find and path[1] must be 0
⍝ Left argument:
⍝      component number where the actual data has already been stored
⍝ Right argument:
⍝      key to be inserted into the B-tree at the given path-location

 ⍝ Insert new component # & key value into B-tree leaf node (this must be a leaf node to get here)
 leaf←⎕fread tn,2 1⊃path ⍝ Get the leaf node to modify with a new entry
 t←1-⍨2 2⊃path ⋄ leaf←(t↑¨leaf),¨component(⊂key),¨t↓¨leaf ⍝ There will always be room
 leaf ⎕freplace tn,2 1⊃path ⍝ Put the modified leaf node back
